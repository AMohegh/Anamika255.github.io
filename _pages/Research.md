I am a NASA Earth Science Fellow pursuing an interdisciplinary Ph.D. at Purdue University. My research interests are at the intersection of Statistical Physics, Complex Networks, Urban Meteorology, and Remote Sensing. I have a sustained interest in the complexity, inter-dependency, and dynamism of complex socio-technological urban systems, and am passionate about engineering smart, resilient cities. My doctoral thesis is focused on characterizing *intra-urban complexity* of the Urban Heat Island. Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained degrees in Civil and Architectural Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology and Purdue respectively.


## Doctoral Research Themes

| **Urban Heat Islands as an archipelago of Fractal intra-urban heat islets** <br> <br> Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) are traditionally quantified by a bulk metric of SUHI Intensity. However, cities are highly spatially heterogeneous and temperatures within vary widely. Inspired by the [fractal nature of cities](http://www.complexcity.info/), we show for the first time, that for diverse cities across the world, SUHIs are fractal in nature. We analyze the SUHI as a collection of *intra-urban heat islets* and leverage the self-similarity to develop comprehensive metrics to quantify intra-urban thermal complexity. <br> <br> Read more: [[SPIE Remote Sensing](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2501441)] [[EarthArXiv Preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/t9s3g)] [In press with Phys. Rev. E.]  | <img src="/assets/images/PRE_pic2.png" width="1600px" alt=""> |

| **Paradox of expansion vs densification for reducing extreme urban heat** <br> <br> Cities are at the forefront of climate change impacts and face a growing burden of adaptation to ensuing natural hazards such as extreme heat. As a result, there is an increasing scientific interest in the influence of diverse urban morphologies on UHI. Here, we build upon the multi-scale framework of intra-urban heat islets and investigate the impact of expansion (sprawl) vs densification of cities on the emergence of extreme heat islets. We find that a sprawling configuration is favorable for reducing the mean temperature of a city. However, for the same mean SUHI intensity, it also results in higher local thermal extremes.  <br> <br> Read more: [[EarthArXiv Preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/gxj9m/)] [In review with Scientific Reports] | <img src="/assets/images/NSR_pic.png" width="1800px" alt=""> |

### Influence of heat waves on intra-urban heat islets

I am currently working in collaboration with NOAA's [Center for Earth System Sciences and Remote Sensing Technologies (NOAA-CESSRST)](https://www.noaacrest.org/) to explore the impact of mesoscale heat waves on the dynamics of intra-urban heat islets. |

# Master's Research Themes

### Resilience Analysis of Climate Proofing strategies of cities.

Urban Resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow despite any acute shock or chronic stress that might occur. And with the advent of climate change, it is becoming more important to help our communities withstand the subsequent extreme weather events. Cities around the world have come together in a global network called the [C-40](https://www.c40.org/), in an attempt to “climate proof” themselves. [Here](/assets/files/C40_report.pdf), we investigate the [top 100 strategies](https://issuu.com/sustainia/docs/cities100) adopted by world’s leading cities in the year 2015 using the [Resilience Landscape model](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/inline.html), which describes the four components of resilience – resistance, latitude, precariousness, and panarchy. Each individual strategy from the case studies was studied as a component of resilience built. Preliminary analysis reveals that most of them are focused on reducing Carbon emissions only. It brings into question if reducing emissions can equate to climate proofing. With this model of resilience, we are able to demonstrate the application of various aspects of resilience in a holistic way. |
