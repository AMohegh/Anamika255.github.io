I am a NASA Earth Science Fellow pursuing an interdisciplinary Ph.D. at Purdue University. My research interests are at the intersection of Complex Systems and Urban Climate. I have a sustained interest in the complexity, inter-dependency, and dynamism of complex socio-technological urban systems, and am very passionate about engineering smart, resilient cities. My doctoral research is focused on characterizing **intra-urban complexity** of the Urban Heat Island. Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained degrees in Civil and Architectural Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology and Purdue respectively.
