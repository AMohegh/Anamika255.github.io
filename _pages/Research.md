I am a NASA Earth Science Fellow pursuing an interdisciplinary Ph.D. at Purdue University. My research interests are at the intersection of Complex Systems and Urban Climate. My doctoral research is focused on characterizing **intra-urban complexity** of the Urban Heat Island. I am currently working on a spatially-embedded Complex Networks model of urban heat flows to evaluate the role of the spatial distribution of urban form and functions in reducing extreme urban heat. Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained degrees in Civil and Architectural Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology and Purdue respectively.
I have a sustained interest in the complexity, inter-dependency, and dynamism of complex socio-technological urban systems, and am very passionate about engineering smart, resilient cities.
