Hello!! I am Anamika. I am currently a doctoral student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) pursuing an interdisciplinary Ph.D. I have a [background](/assets/files/CV.pdf) in Civil and Architectural Engineering, and I am now studying Statistical Physics, Complex Networks, Urban Meteorology, and Remote Sensing for understanding the intra-urban complexity of the Urban Heat Island.

My Ph.D. has been a truly trans-disciplinary and nomadic experience, thanks to the amazing NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship, the benevolence of my Ph.D. advisor - [Prof. Suresh Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/People/view_person?resource_id=2131), and of course, the revolution of Cloud Computing! I have had the privilege to travel extensively for collaborations, workshops, and conferences. I believe that this freedom and global exposure has molded my research philosophy greatly. I am currently based in Palo Alto, California working towards the final stages of my doctoral research and **actively looking for post-doctoral opportunities.**

I come from India, where I have mostly lived in Ranchi - my hometown (now known as [Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni)'s hometown), and in Roorkee - during my undergraduate degree at [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). However, thanks to my parents' avid interest in traveling, I have been all around this incredibly diverse country. I highly recommend it to fellow travelers who love colors, noise, crowds, food, and affordability!

Apart from science, I am into [music](/music/) and maps! I have discovered through my day-to-day Ph.D. work that I love to look at the Earth using satellite imagery. I have spent countless hours on Google Earth and in flights admiring the natural and the engineered beauty (cities) of our planet. To the point where the Neural Networks in my brain now recognize most cities by a fragment of its road network, coastline, bend of its river, night lights distribution, or maybe just a raw Landsat image. These days, I can be found staring at the [Live Aerial screen savers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208992) hosted by Apple TV.
