Hello! I am Anamika Shreevastava. I am a PhD candidate at Purdue University. My research interests lie at the intersection of urban meteorology and complex system science. I use remote sensing and geospatial analysis for my research.

TBA.

When I am procrastinating, I love to just look at the Earth using satellite imagery. I have spent countless hours on Google Earth and in flights admiring the beauty of our planet. Truly blessed that my work was actually responsible for half of that. These days, I can be found staring at the [Live Aerial screen savers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208992) hosted by Apple TV.
