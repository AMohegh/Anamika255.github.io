Hello! I am Anamika. I am currently a doctoral student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) pursuing an interdisciplinary PhD. I have a [background](assets/files/CV_2019_JSMF.pdf) in Civil and Architectural Engineering, and I am now studying Statistical Physics, Complex Networks, Urban Meteorology, and Remote Sensing for understanding the [intra-urban complexity of the Urban Heat Island](/research/).

My PhD has been a truly trans-disciplinary and nomadic experience, thanks to the amazing NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship, the benevolence and wisdom of my PhD Guru - [Prof. Suresh Rao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CE/People/view_person?resource_id=2131), and of course, **Cloud Computing**! I have had the privilege to travel extensively for collaborations, workshops, and conferences. I believe that this freedom and a global exposure has molded my research philosophy greatly. I am currently based in Stanford working towards the final stages of my doctoral research and actively looking for post-doctoral opportunities.

I come from India, where I have mostly lived in Ranchi - my hometown (now known as [Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni)'s hometown), and in Roorkee - where I did my undergraduate degree at [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). However, thanks to my parents' avid interest in traveling, I have been all around this incredibly diverse country. I highly recommend it to fellow travelers who love colors, noise, crowds, and food!

Apart from science, I am into music. I am a singer/guitarist with a [band](/music/) of fellow PhD students at Purdue. I do mostly covers, and have only ever written **one original song**, that was for my best friend, bandmate, fellow scientist, and now husband - [Sai Prasanth](https://sites.google.com/view/saiprasanth).

When I am procrastinating, I love to just look at the Earth using satellite imagery. I have spent countless hours on Google Earth and in flights admiring the beauty of our planet. Luckily for me, my work was actually responsible for half of that. These days, I can be found staring at the [Live Aerial screen savers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208992) hosted by Apple TV.
