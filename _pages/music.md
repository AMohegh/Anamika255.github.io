Apart from science, I am also very interested in music. I am the guitarist and vocalist of an indo-western fusion band at Purdue called [Tatvam](https://www.facebook.com/TatvamPurdue/).


For more, check my band's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBlDeRAwAAP_SeVPqmVi_HQ">YouTube channel</a>.

Here's a look into how most of my Purdue evenings and weekends look like.

During my undergrad in India, I led the IITR Music team (2010-2014). Check out the [awesome group](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUAm7WhqNFUytNPs6VaUK-Q)!
