Some useful tools I have built for my research. Any suggestions for improvement will be highly appreciated.
* [WRF domain designer and visualizer in R markdown](https://anamika255.github.io/reserve/WRF_domain.html)
* [Land Surface Temperature from Landsat images](https://code.earthengine.google.com/36460b55b5c8688d50e27cbb073a0ef9)

## Research groups

Some of the awesome research groups that I have had the pleasure to work with. Check them out and get in touch if you want to collaborate, or work with, or be a part of, or just chat.

* [Complex Networks Synthesis group](https://www.ufz.de/cawr/index.php?en=43129)

Networks are basic structures underlying many natural, social and engineered systems in our environment. Technical networks are e.g. streets, power grids, communication, sewer and water supply networks, while natural networks comprise systems as diverse as river networks, pore structures in the unsaturated zone, food webs and atmospheric transport structures. We study the dynamics and inter-relatedness of these networks. This is an international group of researchers from Purdue University, University of Florida, Gainesville, [Helmholtz Centre of Environmental Research (UFZ)](https://www.ufz.de/cawr/), and Technische University, Dresden who meet twice a year in either Germany or USA. |

* [World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools](http://www.wudapt.org/)

The WUDAPT project is a community-based project to gather a census of consistent urban land use land classes maps for cities around the world. [Get LCZ maps](https://wudapt.cs.purdue.edu/wudaptTools/default/getlcz). |

## Weather Research Forecasting (WRF)

[**WRF Diaries**](https://anamika255.github.io/portfolio/WRF/): Here I take notes on running WRF. In the hope that the hurdles I have overcome once do not slow me down again. |

## Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis

[**Google Earth Engine**](https://earthengine.google.com/): If you deal with satellite data and geospatial analysis, give this a test drive. |


## Interactive Science Communication

I am extremely passionate about data visualization and visual story-telling. Here are some compelling narratives that inspire me.

[**Parable of the Polygons**](https://ncase.me/polygons/): This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world. Based on Schelling's model of segregation, this playable website neatly explains why today's society seems demographically segregated.|

[**Fireflies**](https://ncase.me/fireflies/): How small-interactions can lead to large-scale organization. |

[**Complexity Explorables**](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/): Interacting with complex systems is the best way to understand the simple rules that gives rise to chaotic outcomes. I encourage you to play around and find analogies to any system of your interest. |

[**NetLogo**](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/): Agent-based modeling visualized. |

[**How much hotter is your hometown?**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/30/climate/how-much-hotter-is-your-hometown.html): On climate change communication. |

<!-- [Hottest year on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/hottest-year-on-record/) -->

## Managing Grad-Life

[**The art of spaced repetition**](https://ncase.me/remember/): To accept that the expertise you once had will fade with time. All we can do is find time to relearn old tricks as we learn new ones. |

[**Calendar. Not to-do lists.**](https://blog.usejournal.com/calendar-in-stead-of-to-do-lists-9ada86a512dd): When it comes to time management, I am not a calendar-based planner. But if you are, check this out this amazing blog post.|

[**WorkFlowy**](https://workflowy.com/): Instead, I like to make lists! |
