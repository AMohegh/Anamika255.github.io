Some useful tools I have built for my research. Any suggestions for improvement will be highly appreciated.

* [WRF domain visualizer in Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/b49019fd1f97e7313b143992a717726c)
* [Land Surface Temperature from Landsat images](https://code.earthengine.google.com/36460b55b5c8688d50e27cbb073a0ef9)

### Interactive Science Communication

I am extremely passionate about data visualization and visual story-telling. Here are some compelling narratives that inspire me.

* This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world. Based on Schelling's model of segregation, this playable website neatly explains why today's society seems demographically segregated: [Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/)
* Interacting with complex systems is the best way to understand the simple rules that gives rise to chaotic outcomes. I encourage you to play around and find analogies to any system of your interest: [Complexity Explorables](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/)
* Agent-based modeling visualized: [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
* A tool for thinking in systems: [Loopy](https://ncase.me/loopy/)
* [Hottest year on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/hottest-year-on-record/)

### Computational resources

* If you deal with geospatial analysis and haven't used [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) yet, please do!

### Managing Grad-Life

* [The art of spaced repetition](https://ncase.me/remember/)
* When it comes to time management, I am not a calendar-based planner. But if you are, check this out this amazing blog post: [Calendar. Not to-do lists.](https://blog.usejournal.com/calendar-in-stead-of-to-do-lists-9ada86a512dd).
* Instead, I like to make lists! Check out [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com/)
